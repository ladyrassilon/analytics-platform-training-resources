A tool called conda is used to install packages
for use in `R` studio.

Sometimes, conda gets into a bad state.

This video walks you through resetting your home directory to a known clean
state by using the Ministry of Justice's Analytical Platform.

Please ensure you confirm that you want to reset
your home directory.

click on the open button.

Continue to use `R` studio in the usual way.

Since your home directory has been reset, you will have to re-install any
packages with conda.

The important thing to remember is that you're starting to use conda
from a clean state.
